        <p><i>Colonel Harland David Sanders (September 9, 1890 â€“ December 16, 1980) was an American businessman, best known for founding fast food chicken restaurant chain Kentucky Fried Chicken (now known as KFC) and later acting as the company's brand ambassador and symbol.</i></p><br>
      
      <h4>Life Timeline</h4>
      <ul> 
        <li><b>1890:</b> Born in a 4 room house in Henryville, Indiana</li>
        <li><b>1895:</b> Father came home with a fever and died that day. Harland's mother found work at a tomato cannery, and Harland was left in charge of caring for his siblings. He became skilled at cooking.</li>
        <li><b>1902:</b> His mother remarried, and the family moved to Greenwood, Indiana</li>
        <li><b>1903:</b> Sanders didn't get along with his stepfather, and ran away at the age of 13. He took odd jobs to get by.</li>
        <li><b>1906:</b> Sanders falisified his date of bith in order to enlist in the US Army.</li>
        <li><b>1907 - 1909:</b> After being discharged honorably after his service in Cuba, Sanders moved around the south, and held a variety of jobs, from blacksmith helper to fireman. </li>
        <li><b>1909:</b> Met and married Josephine King. They eventually had three children, a son, Harland Jr., and two daughters, Margaret and Mildred.</li>
        <li><b>1909 - 1915: </b>Sanders studied law by correspondence through the La Salle Extension University. Eventually he began practicing law in Little Rock, Arkansas. His legal career ended after a courtroom brawl with his own client.</li>
        <li><b>1920 - 1930:</b> Sanders established a succesful ferry boat company. Sanders takes the money from his ferry boat company and sinks it into a failed venture in acetylene lamps. </li>
        <li><b>1924:</b> Moved to Winchester, Kentucky to work at as a tire salesman. He lost his job, and then was asked to run a gas station, which closed in 1930, as a result of the Great Depression.</li>
        <li><b>1930: </b>Shell Oil Company offered Sanders a service station in North Corbin, Kentucky, rent free, in return for a percentage of the sales. Sanders began selling chicken dishes at his gas station, first serving customers in his living quarters, then opening a restaurant. Sanders was involved with a shootout with a local competitor over the repainting of a sign directing traffic to his station. Stewart killed a Shell official who was with Sanders and was convited of murder.</li>
        <li><b>1935:</b> Sanders was commissioned as a Kentucky Colonel by the governor Ruby Laffoon.</li>
        <li><b>1939 - 1942:</b> Sanders acquired a motel in Asheville, North Carolina. His North Corbin restaurant and motel was destroyed in a fire in November 1939, and Sanders had it rebuilt as a motel with a 140-seat restaurant. By July 1940, Sanders had finalized his "Secret Recipe" for frying chicken in a pressure fryer that cooked the chicken faster than pan frying. As the United States entered World War II in December 1941, gas was rationed, and as the tourists dried up, Sanders was forced to close his Asheville motel. He went to work as a supervisor in Seattle until the latter part of 1942.[6] He later ran cafeterias for the government at an ordnance works in Tennessee, followed by a job as assistant cafeteria manager in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.</li>
        <li><b>1952: </b>In 1952, Sanders franchised "Kentucky Fried Chicken" for the first time, to Pete Harman of South Salt Lake, Utah, the operator of one of that city's largest restaurants. In the first year of selling the product, restaurant sales more than tripled, with 75% of the increase coming from sales of fried chicken. For Harman, the addition of fried chicken was a way of differentiating his restaurant from competitors; in Utah, a product hailing from Kentucky was unique and evoked imagery of Southern hospitality. Don Anderson, a sign painter hired by Harman, coined the name Kentucky Fried Chicken. After Harman's success, several other restaurant owners franchised the concept and paid Sanders $0.04 per chicken.</li>
        <li><b>1959: </b>Left only with his savings and $105 a month from Social Security, Sanders decided to begin to franchise his chicken concept in earnest, and traveled the US looking for suitable restaurants. After closing the North Corbin site, Sanders and Claudia opened a new restaurant and company headquarters in Shelbyville in 1959. Often sleeping in the back of his car, Sanders visited restaurants, offered to cook his chicken, and if workers liked it negotiated franchise rights.</li>
        <li><b>1964:</b> The franchise approach became highly successful; KFC was one of the first fast food chains to expand internationally, opening outlets in Canada and later in England, Mexico and Jamaica by the mid-1960s. The company's rapid expansion to more than 600 locations became overwhelming for the aging Sanders. In 1964, then 73 years old, he sold the Kentucky Fried Chicken corporation for $2 million ($15.3 million today) to a partnership of Kentucky businessmen headed by John Y. Brown, Jr. (a then-29-year-old lawyer and future governor of Kentucky) and Jack C. Massey (a venture capitalist and entrepreneur), and he became a salaried brand ambassador. The initial deal did not include the Canadian operations (which Sanders retained) or the franchising rights in England, Florida, Utah, and Montana (which Sanders had already sold to others).</li>
        <li><b>1964 - 1979: </b>Sanders remained the company's symbol after selling it, traveling 200,000 miles a year on the company's behalf and filming many TV commercials and appearances. He retained much influence over executives and franchisees, who respected his culinary expertise and feared what The New Yorker described as "the force and variety of his swearing" when a restaurant or the company varied from what executives described as "the Colonel's chicken". Sanders continued touring restaurants up until 1979. </li>
        <li><b>1980:</b> Sanders was diagnosed with acute leukemia in July. He died in December of the same year at the age of 90.</li>
